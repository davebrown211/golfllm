- Video descriptions for collaborations
- Comments mentioning other channels
```

### 2. **From Our Data**
```python
# Query our database for:
- Channels with only 1-2 videos but high views (we should get more from them)
- Channel names mentioned in video titles
- Patterns in successful content
```

### 3. **Golf Community Sources**
